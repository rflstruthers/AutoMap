# AutoMap
AutoMap GeoFence ASP.NET Project

Uses ASP.NET, Entity Framework, and Google Maps JavaScript API.

I was contracted by AutoMap, LLC to create a GeoFence web application. I was asked to create an ASP.NET Web App that allows users to view companies associated with their credentials, as well as view, edit, and delete geographical areas associated with each company. I was tasked with using the Google Maps JavaScript API for area viewing and editing, and existing REST webservice calls to get company and area information.
